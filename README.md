# 🌋 Volcano Eruption Modelling Using Blender

This project is an immersive Augmented Reality / Virtual Reality simulation of a **volcanic eruption**, created using **Blender 3D**. It showcases a realistic and dynamic volcanic landscape, integrating fluid dynamics, particle systems, shaders, and compositing effects to create a stunning visual experience.

## 🎯 Project Overview
The project simulates a realistic volcanic eruption in a virtual environment. Through Blender's powerful modeling and simulation tools, this project aims to deliver an engaging and educational AR/VR experience that captures the scale, intensity, and atmosphere of an erupting volcano.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Blender 3.0+** – for 3D modeling, sculpting, simulation, and rendering
- **Blender Add-ons** – Landscape tool, Node Wrangler, etc.
- **Texture & Shader Techniques** – Emission shaders, bump maps, fluid materials
- **Simulation Systems** – Particle, fluid, smoke, and collision simulations
- **Compositing** – Mist, glow, and post-processing enhancements
- **Audio Integration** – Synced volcano eruption sound for added realism

## 🧩 Features Implemented
- Sculpted terrain with realistic volcanic ridges and craters
- Fluid simulation for lava flows with customizable direction, velocity, and viscosity
- Particle systems for sparks, ash clouds, and glowing debris
- Smoke simulation with force fields and turbulence
- Volumetric lighting and HDRI environment for cinematic effects
- Shader-based materials for lava, rocks, and smoke
- Real-time animation with keyframed eruption sequences
- Audio integration synced to the eruption
- Compositing effects such as glow, mist, and color grading

## 🖥️ System Requirements

### Minimum:
- **RAM**: 8GB +
- **GPU**: 4GB VRAM (e.g., NVIDIA GTX 1060) 
- **Storage**: 100GB SSD  
- **Display**: Full HD monitor  
- **Software**: Blender 3.0+, Windows/Linux/macOS

##  🛠️ Setup Instructions
Here are the concise steps for setting up and running the Blender project on volcano eruption:
1. Download Software: Install the latest version of [Blender 3.0](https://www.blender.org/download/)
2. Clone Project: Clone your GitHub repository containing the .blend files using Git
3. Open Blend File: Launch Blender and open the ".blend" file from the cloned repository. Ensure all necessary Blender add-ons are enabled, such as the landscape and node wrangler add-ons.
4. Run the Simulation: Adjust any required simulation settings (e.g., fluid dynamics, particle system). Hit F12 to render the scene, or press Alt+A to run the simulation for visualization.


## 📈 Outcomes
